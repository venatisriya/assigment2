# assigment2

I first assigned the varible assignment2 with the given data. I then created the function myMean as provided. Running the myMean function with the assignment2 data I obtained a mean of 19.25 and verified with a calculator using mathematical formula. This shows that the provided function calculates the maean of any given set of numbers correctly. My code is as shown below.


assignment2 = c(16, 18,14,22,27,17,19,17,17,22,20,22)
> assignment2
 [1] 16 18 14 22 27 17 19 17 17 22 20 22
> myMean <-function(assignment2) {
+ return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))}
> myMean(assignment2)
[1] 19.25
